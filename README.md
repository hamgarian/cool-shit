this is a list of applications / services / tools / basically anything that i tried and find really cool

## AI / Machine Learning
- **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** `S Tier` - the gateway drug to machine learning, run python code in the web and get a free gpu, you can even expose it to the web using tools like ngrok, pinggy, playit.gg, and cloudflared
- **[Modal](https://modal.com/)** `S Tier` - oh you want google colab but as a SERVERLESS api? oh did I mention A100 GPUs with 80 gb vram for free? godly tool for anyone interested in running, training, and deploying AI models. goated fucking site.
- **[Whisper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WLYoBvA3YNKQ0X2lC9udUOmjK7rZgAwr)** `A Tier` - make subtitles out of any speech
- **[HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)** `A Tier` - you wanna try out those popular cool ai models but you dont wanna set shit up? just use a huggingface space that's running on zeroGpu, gives you a free H200 to run AI models and shit 
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** `S Tier` - so you're telling me this shit automates every boring part of programming? hell yeah
- **[Google AI Studio + The API](https://aistudio.google.com/)** `S Tier` - i can modify settings of one of the most powerful LLMs right now and use it programmatically through the API for FREE? well as long you link it to your google cloud free trial 
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)** `A Tier` - smartest AI right now, but limits your prompts faster than you can finish your project

## Creative Tools
- **[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)** `S Tier` - photoshop... but faster, ligher, web-based, local, and most importantly... FOR FREE? hell yeah
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** `S Tier` - goated for designing anything vector based and easy to automate
- **After Effects** `A Tier` (pirate it) - nothing comes close to motion graphics, effects, smoothness as good as after effects, only con is that it's one of the most unoptimized software i've ever fucking seen
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** `S Tier` - greatest 3d modeling app i've ever seen, tbh not just limited to that, you could draw here, edit videos here, make a full on recreation of arcane, or just make renders, great software

## Game Dev
- **[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)** `S Tier` - can do 3d, can do 2d, can be a backend simulation server too (if you didn't know that), open source, great community
- **[Unity](https://unity.com/)** `A Tier` - massive ecosystem, you can pretty much make any game idea here, but has a controversial reputation

## Self Hosting
- **[Coolify](https://coolify.io/)** `S Tier` - makes hosting and deploying apps so much fucking tolerable, feels similar to vercel but you can deploy literally any shit here from web.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** `S Tier` - coolify's life support, makes dependency hell virtually non-existant, no more "it works on my machine tho"

## Free VPS
- **[Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/asean/cloud/)** `S Tier` - anything a compsci student could ever dream of, your own server hosting any shit u want, 24 gb ram, 8 vCPU, 10 TB bandwidth, and RUNS FOREVER FOR FREE! catch is registering is hard and you need to make sure you don't let the vps go idle or else it goes bye bye, easy to workaround tho, also requires CREDIT CARD for verification so yeah good luck
- **[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)** `A Tier` - a student's first feel of being a devops engineer, 300$ free credit with a debit card for 3 months, great for learning and testing shit out, bad if you want shit to last forever, also alot of great APIs
 
## Databases
- **[Turso](https://turso.tech/)** `S Tier` - gives the biggest storage than anyone out there that's actually legit
- **[Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)** `S Tier`
- **[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/)** `S Tier`
