- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** `S Tier` - greatest 3d modeling app i've ever seen, tbh not just limited to that, you could draw here, edit videos here, make a full on recreation of arcane, or just make renders, great software

- **[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)** `A Tier` - a student's first feel of being a devops engineer, 300$ free credit with a debit card for 3 months, great for learning and testing shit out, bad if you want shit to last forever, also alot of great APIs
